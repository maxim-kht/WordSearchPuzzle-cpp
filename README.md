
Word Search Puzzle
------------------

C++ implementation of the program I originally wrote in Java.

Popular algorithms/programming exercise.

Word search puzzle that allows user to find the words in the word grid and outputs their coordinates in a following format: "(xStart, yStart), (xEnd, yEnd)".

The program prompts the user to enter the dimensions of the grid, which contains letters in an alphabetical order and allows user to search specified amount of words in two different modes: wrap and non-wrap. 

In non-wrap mode the puzzle works like the regular word puzzle: only the words inside the grid are searched.

In a wrap mode if the word hits the border it continues on the other side of the grid. For example:

A B C         
D E F          
G H I          

If we chose the wrap mode and try to search for ABCAB the program will find the word and will output the following coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1). 

The search is performed in all 8 directions.
